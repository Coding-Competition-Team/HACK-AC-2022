I really hate script kiddies... There was one guy recently going around talking about his new website. All he did was
copy **my** website!!! >:(  

Now all he does all day is look at the new posts people send him... He even announced that he uses a password autofill
manager to make sure no one steals his creds and views his own post. We need to teach these script kiddies a lesson!  

btw you can sign up for an account just by logging in with your new creds (that's how kool my site is)
