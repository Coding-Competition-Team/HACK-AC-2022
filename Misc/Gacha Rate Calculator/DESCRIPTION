Isn't it cool how I can add 1 to any number, and it'll return number + 1? Simply amazing! 

I intend to use this for my new Genshin clone. Whenever someone rolls for a new character, I'll add 1 to the global RNG pool until it reaches the upper limit and drops something good. What they don't know is, there's no upper limit to this RNG pool...
